# Hi, I'm Roman 👋

I'm a software engineer currently working as a **full-stack developer**, with a strong personal interest in **numerical methods, GPU computing, and performance-oriented systems**.

My background is a bit unconventional:

- I studied **linear algebra, numerical methods, and mechanics** at university.
- I previously worked as a **mechanical / structural (FEA) engineer**, using tools like **ANSYS** and **Abaqus** for stress analysis.
- Over time, I became increasingly interested in how these systems work internally — both mathematically and computationally.
- That curiosity eventually led me into **software engineering**, where I took the most accessible entry path at the time: **web development**.

## What I work on now

Professionally, I work as a **full-stack engineer**, building web applications and systems end-to-end.

In parallel, I explore topics that connect my engineering background with software:

- Numerical linear algebra and iterative solvers  
- GPU computing for both **graphics and computation**  
- Web-based compute via **WebGL / WebGPU**  
- Rust for performance-critical and systems-level code  
- Architecture patterns for scientific and engineering software  

A central personal project is [`fea_app`](https://github.com/RomanShushakov/fea_app), where I’ve been building a small finite-element–style analysis tool from scratch — not as a production FEA solver, but as a way to deeply understand:

- how numerical methods map to code,
- how computation interacts with GPUs,
- and how modern web technologies can be used for scientific workloads.

## Interests going forward

While I currently work in web development, my long-term interests are gradually shifting back toward:

- **numerical computing and solvers**
- **GPU-accelerated computation**
- **scientific / engineering software**
- and eventually **HPC-style workloads**, whether on native platforms or in the browser

I enjoy learning by building things end-to-end — from math and algorithms down to execution models and performance characteristics.

## Tech I enjoy working with

- **Languages**: Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript  
- **Compute & Graphics**: WebGPU, WebGL  
- **Domains**: numerical methods, linear algebra, FEA concepts  
- **General**: performance-aware programming, system design, tooling

Thanks for stopping by 🙂
